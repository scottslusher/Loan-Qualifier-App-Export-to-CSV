# Loan Qualifier App Export to CSV

Welcome to my repository for the Loan Qualifier App Export to CSV (LQExport). The purpose of this App is to help the user identify potential banks they can use to qualify for a home loan based on basic financial information they input. Once they have identified those banks they will have the option to export the filtered dataset to a csv file, or view the list within the CLI.
