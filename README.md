## Loan Qualifier App Export to CSV (LQExport)

Welcome to my repository for the Loan Qualifier App Export to CSV (LQExport). The purpose of this App is to help the user identify potential banks they can use to qualify for a home loan based on basic financial information they input. Once they have identified those banks they will have the option to export the filtered dataset to a csv file, or view the list within the CLI.

## Usage

To use the LQExport application you must have your data saved in a folder path easily accessible and in a .csv format. 

To launch the program simply clone the repository and run app.py
' python app.py

You will be greated with a new set of initial directions to refresh the users memory of how the application operates.

Once the user has read and accepted the instructions the app will ask for a file path to the csv file that holds the bank information the user would like to filter.

As shown in the clip above: When inputing your file path just begin typing the name of the folder ("da") and you should notice a 'data' autocomplete request under the letters. If this is the correct folder you can hit TAB to complete the name. Same can be done for the name of the csv file.

Once you have completed entering in your file path you must hit ENTER twice in order to get to the next level of information inputs.
